These ideas have been super beneficial to me in my life at least in so much as I’ve managed to bumble my way through thus far. It’s nice to have a mental framework that helps keep you in a good place when the world turns upside down.

Here goes …

1. Being alive today is something to be celebrated. What am I going to do with this new day I’ve been given?
2. Pick my priorities carefully. Don’t let the world do this for me. And when I have them, defend them.
3. Learn something new every day.
4. Write a lot. Writing helps me think.
5. Read more than I write. Learning from the successes and mistakes of other people can save me much pain. (Nobody successful got that way without failing a lot.)
6. Make time for self reflection. What were some of the key decisions I made today? How did I do? What could I have done differently?
7. Mistakes are things to be learned from. Not things to derail me for large amounts of time. Everything is fine.
8. Never attribute to malice what could just as easily be incompetence. This seems to make me less grumpy. 🙂
9. Be a good listener.
10. I like the beginner’s mind idea – “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.” The quicker I get to solutioning, the sooner I leave the land of possibilities ...
11. The mindset I want : “I know I’m right.” -> “How do I know I’m right?”.
12. Being able to change ones mind about a thing is a mark of intelligence. Don't sweat it.
