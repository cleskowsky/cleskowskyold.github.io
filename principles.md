Some big ideas that have been super beneficial to me in my life:

1. Being alive today is something to be grateful for. What am I going to do with this new day I’ve been given?
2. Pick my priorities carefully. Don’t let the world do this for me. And when I have them, defend them.
3. Related to 2, pick the people around me carefully too. The way I think and see the world varies directly with who is nearby.
4. Mistakes are things to be learned from, not things worth being sad about for the most part. Everything’s fine!
5. Never attribute to malice what could just as easily be incompetence. This seems to make me less grumpy. 🙂
6. Be a good listener.
7. [“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) The quicker I get to solutioning, the sooner I leave the land of possibilities!

## Things that make me happy
- Being around people I care about.
- Helping others.
