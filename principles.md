These ideas have been super beneficial to me in my life at least in so much as I’ve managed to bumble my way through thus far. It’s nice to have a mental framework that helps keep you in a good place when the world turns upside down.

Here goes …

1. I’m alive today. Right now even! This is something to be celebrated. What am I going to do with this new day I’ve been given?
2. Pick your priorities. Don’t let the world do this for you. Defend them.
3. Learn something new every day.
4. Write a lot. Writing helps me think.
5. Read more than I write. Learning from the successes and mistakes of other people can save me much pain. (Nobody successful got that way without failing a lot.)
6. Make time for self reflection. What were some of the key decisions I made today? How did I do? What could I have done differently? Sometimes it may take time for today’s decisions to prove out. (Or not.) Be mindful of whichever way things go. Constantly look for ways to incorporate learning from mistakes into better, future decision making.
7. Look for ways to make mistakes valuable. Things to be learned from and not completely dibilitating.
8. Never attribute to malice what could just as easily be incompetence. This seems to make me less grumpy. 🙂
9. Be a good listener. Empathy is a great capacity to develop.
10. I like the idea of the beginner’s mind – “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.”
11. Everyday I’m faced with a huge gap between what I know and what I need to know. What do I do when I don’t know what to do? 🙂
12. The mindset I want : “I know I’m right.” -> “How do I know I’m right?”.
13.Question everything.
14. Be ready to change my mind when I need to.
15. Be humble.
