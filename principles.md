These ideas have been super beneficial to me in my life. It’s nice to have a mental framework that helps keep you in a good place when the world turns upside down …

1. Being alive today is something to be grateful for. What am I going to do with this new day I’ve been given?
2. Pick my priorities carefully. Don’t let the world do this for me. And when I have them, defend them.
3. Mistakes are things to be learned from, not things worth being sad about. Mostly. Everything’s fine!
4. Never attribute to malice what could just as easily be incompetence. This seems to make me less grumpy. 🙂
5. Be a good listener.
6. “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.” The quicker I get to solutioning, the sooner I leave the land of possibility!
