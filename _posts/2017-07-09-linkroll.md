# __https://slack.engineering/how-slack-supports-junior-engineers-89f6dcfe74a1__

The first few months involve close mentorship by a senior engineer as well as meeting regularly with your manager. There are goals set out that help grow new team members and develop independence. @Slack the most import first goal is to learn how to write a good pull request.

What are a good set of initial goals for my team?

People are encouraged to try new ways of working / solving problems (eg you think tdd will make your work better? try it!) and learn something from the experience.

Everyone owns their own development.
