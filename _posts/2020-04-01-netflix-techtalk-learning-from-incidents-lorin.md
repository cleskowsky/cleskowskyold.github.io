I like the term he uses to describe the unexpected in production "Operational surprises"

What do we hope to learn?
- Tooling gaps
- Process gaps
- Knowledge gaps
    - Mental model gaps
- Resource gaps: The law of stretched systems ... socio-technical systems. Any team / system will eventually be running at capacity. What happens when you try to put more work in the system
    - How can you tell when a skilled engineer becomes overloaded? It just looks like they're busy until they fail
    - Is a system staffed properly for there responsibilities

"How did we get here?" What were the series of events that got us here?
Incident review template title: How did we get here?

"How did X seem reasonable in the moment?"

Narrative story as a critical section in the incident review. (postmortem) This isn't the timeline. A timeline is important too. This data is fed back into a story that humans can hear and tell and feel something about.
