I remember thinking to myself, "The people at NASA have always seemed near superhuman to me. When you look at successful people, you don't always see what it took for them to get there. You see outcomes. There was very likelylots of doubt, failure, and terror getting there! :)

# Notes

"7 minutes of terror": the time between the lander entering the martian atmosphere and when it lands when it's stops communicating with earth altogether and you hope it makes it but so many things can go wrong

A powerful question: Has life ever appeared anywhere else in the universe? Mission statements can bring people together.

# Chapter 2

Constraints can help us get creative: Pathfinder was an earlier mars mission that had some interesting ones:
- Small
- Planned basic research
- New launch / landing platform (Combination of heat shields, parachutes, airbags.)
- Relatively small budget

A mistake where a program was getting values in units it wasn't expecting caused total mission failure (When you're doing something for the first time expect some things will go wrong. Build contingencies and backup plans where the investment in time, money, and effort is justified ...)
