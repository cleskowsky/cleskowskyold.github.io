I remember thinking to myself, "These guys that do amazing things at Nasa and in space seem superhuman almost but they're just people. Incredibly focused, driven people. But people. They make mistakes just like me and have hopes and fears just like me." This was a big takeaway for me - when you look at successful people, you don't always see what it took for them to get there. You see the output. The final result. Victory! There was very likelylots of doubt, failure, and terror getting there! :)
