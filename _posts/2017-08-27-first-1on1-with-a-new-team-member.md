# Happy

- What makes you grumpy? Great ice breaker. Light. Fun. Can go in so many interesting directions potentially.
- How will I know when you’re grumpy?
- How can I help when you’re grumpy?

# Feedback

- Where do you like to receive feedback? (In person, IRC, etc)
- Would you prefer public or private recognition?

# Learning

- __Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of? This one is kind of interesting.__ Not sure how often I can use it but it’s gets to certain aspects of how a person is doing.
The most important question

# Fun

- What is your favourite baked good?
