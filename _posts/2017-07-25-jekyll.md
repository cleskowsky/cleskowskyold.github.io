Recently moved away from a dynamic, Wordpress hosted blog to a staticly generated one with Jekyll hosted by Github at Github pages. What a monumental difference. I don't have to worry about keeping Wordpress up to date anymore. (A burden unto itself.) I'm not personally responsible for a db, an app server, and php with a complex bit of software anymore. (Github does this for me although I think their hosting situation is also simpler because they're dealing with a static site.)

Breathe. :)
