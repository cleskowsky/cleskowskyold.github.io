# What poker teaches you about life

+ Separate thought process from outcomes
+ Happy when process is good regardless of outcome (doesn't matter win / lose)
+ Sad when process is bad
+ Making decisions with incomplete or false information
+ Being comfortable with the uncertainty
+ There are only so many things you can control. The other stuff will land as it does. Every novel context goes through the same process
