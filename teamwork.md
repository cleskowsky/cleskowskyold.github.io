A place for me to scribble down notes around what sorts of things create an environment where good team work is possible. I'm bumping into these kinds of ideas all the time because of the people I look up to and follow.

These thoughts are very likely half-baked and are certainly taken out of context, and yet I think I will still find them useful.

# Good tools ...

- Are easy to use
- Encourage and enhance collaboration
- Encourage communication between teams
- Apply consistently to all environments (vs we do this weird this over here if you're in dev, otherwise ...)
- Have apis and are scriptable
- Are easily configured with config stored in source control
- Promote learning
