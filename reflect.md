![Why we monitor]({{ site.url }}/img/reflect/corywatson-why-we-monitor.png)

Through data, we should be helping developers see the effects their changes are having on a system.

How to create a movement
- find first movers, people that are as excited as you about a thing
- [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), blaze some trails
- sales, talk about what you're doing
- humility, ask people what they're doing because you don't know and would love to help if you can <-don't tell them they're doing things wrong
- specific solutions+tools aren't important, make sure you get the higher order goals
- make it easy, people have important work to do <-don't make their lives harder than they are now
- [CASE](http://onemogin.com/monitoring/case-method-better-monitoring-for-humans.html) !! (Context heavy, actionable, symptom based, evaluated regularly)

- each alert gets a custom dashboard
