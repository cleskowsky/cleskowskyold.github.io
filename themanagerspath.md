"Entry level job" - Chapter 4 first quote, Marc Hedlund :)

# Chapter 4 Managing people

- 1on1s
- onboarding
- feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, praise
- working with team memeber to identify areas for learning and helping them grow into them (project work, mentoring, external learning)

Create a 30/60/90 day plan: basic goals (these I like as starter ones ... will use for coops) learning code, architecture, how to write a pull request, shipping code (phased deployment, testing, etc)

New hires provide an opportunity to hear about their initial experience with the team. What was great? What could've been better?
