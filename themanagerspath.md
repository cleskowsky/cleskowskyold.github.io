# Chapter 4 Managing people

"Entry level job" - Chapter 4 first quote, Marc Hedlund :)

__Key points__

- 1on1s
- onboarding
- feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, praise
- working with team memeber to identify areas for learning and helping them grow into them (project work, mentoring, external learning)

Create a 30/60/90 day plan: basic goals (these I like as starter ones ... will use for coops) learning code, architecture, how to write a pull request, shipping code (phased deployment, testing, etc)

New hires provide an opportunity to hear about their initial experience with the team. What was great? What could've been better?

Jeff is like Sharell and Beth. He communicates intent, motivation and gives room to let me figure out a path through the work. He's there if / when he's needed and can hop in when necessary. eg Release 4 needed a cross team effort in devtools to get to a rel4 dev cluster from the GUI.
