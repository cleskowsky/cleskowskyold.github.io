# Agile

Stories should be written to fit INVEST criteria:

- Independent : One story doesn't depend on another (relates to no technical stories!). Any one story could be the next. The customer has the final say
- Negotiable : A story is a promise to communicate not something that is set in stone
- Valuable : Stories are small enough to be delivered to customers at a reasonable cadence. The customer can see that there is momentum and they can effect outcomes but choosing when gets done. This creates engagement
- Estimate-able : You should have some sense of how long a thing will take. If you're not confident, research is required
- Small : Much less than a full sprint. I've found a day's worth of effort to be good
- Tested : How do you know you're done?
