# Growth

> At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind.  It costs you relatively little to do this, but the benefit to them, and to the broader world, may be enormous. - Tyler Cowen

# Building New Stuff (Product Management)

- [Michael Cote @Pivotal](https://medium.com/@cote/a-small-series-of-projects-d6107c3d9d3e)

How to think about / start bigger cultural+tech transformations at companies. How to select initial products to move:
- Group exercise!
- Eisenhower matrix
- Get stakeholders into a room and ask each for their top projects. Arrange on 4 square grid important / urgent. Couple of tricks for concensus.
  - [Dot voting + other decision making techniques](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/6-decision-making-techniques-all-product-managers-should-know#f923)

How to build momentum. How to avoid fast failure with forces that would avoid change. (Status quo is a hard hill to climb. "But I really need to get my stuff done. I don't have time to try this new thing!")

# Time horizons, iterations, small batches

Jason Fried has some timely advice for me today. Namely the benefits to working in small batches can have psychological impacts in addition to business, workflow ones:

Peak energy for long duration projects high at kickoff, then tapers off

Peak energy for projects delivered iteratively renews every cycle
