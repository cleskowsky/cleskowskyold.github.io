We're going to Japan this year and I couldn't be more pumped! I grew up on tiny bits of Japanese culture - tv, movies, books, stories, food, etc - and am finding, as an adult, a new kind of appreciation for all of it.

I'll write down notes from our planning here as Carmen and I get this trip sorted.

# Todo

- Plan food experiences (top 10 japan dishes)
- Get disney japan tickets
- Find Mount Fuji tour
- Should we try to find an Akihabara walkabout tour? Do we need to reserve at a maid cafe?

# Meta

- Arrive: October 14, 2017
- Depart
- Where we're staying: Tokyo, Kyoto, Mount Koya

# Notes

## July 8 2017

Today we're deciding which of Chris Rowthorn's tours we'd like to take. He's a small tour operator in the places we'll be visiting that's highly rated on trip advisor. He runs walking tours that promise to take us off the beaten path which I very much like the sound of. :)

So much praise. I don't think I'm going to have trouble signing up for any of these walks...

So we'll be taking a modern Japan walk in Tokyo for 6 hours. And then 2 more days with guides in Kyoto I think. Apparently October is a busy month for Kyoto tourism-wise.

__kyoto (kyoto prices are slightly higher in october)__

- 4 hours, 33000 yen, 375$ cad
- 8 hours, 48000 yen, 542$ cad
- 2 hour evening, 28000 yen, 316$ cad

8 8 4 2 = 542 + 542 + 375 + 316 = 1775$

__tokyo__

- 6 hours, 36000 yen, 407$ cad

Total: ~2100$ if we did everything
